/*Load an image (of your choice) on the left side of the screen, vertically centered. 
The image should start moving to the right until it reaches the other end of the window. 
When the right part of the picture reaches the end of the window, it changes direction and goes to the left. 
When it reaches its original location, everything repeats itself.*/
