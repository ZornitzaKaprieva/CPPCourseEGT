/*Create a C++ program, for a simple library management system. 
The program should include classes for books and library members, and demonstrate the use of objects, methods and pointers.
Requirements:
Book Class:
•	Attributes: title(string), author (string), ISBN (string).
•	Methods:
	-	A constructor to initialize member details.
	-	display () to output member details to the console
Member Class:
•	Attributes: name (string), age (int), memberID (string).
•	Methods:
	-	A constructor to initialize member details.
	-	display () to output member details.
	-	borrowBook (Book *book) to simulate borrowing a book, which takes a pointer to a Book object.
Main Function: 
•	Create an array of Books objects and an array of member objects.
•	Demonstrate the borrowing process by having a member borrow a book.
•	Use pointers to refer to and manipulate the book and member objects.
Task Instructions:
•	Implement the classes as described above.
•	In the main function create at least two Bok objects and two member objects. 
•	Demonstrate the functionality of borrowBook() method by having members borrow books
•	Make sure to use pointers appropriately when implementing the borrowBook method and handling objects in main.
