/*
Inheritance:
Create a base class Shape with a protected attribute color and a public method draw().
Derive two classes from it: Circle and Rectangle.
Override the draw() method to print the shape's color and what shape it is (e.g., "Drawing a red circle").

Polymorphism: 
Implement a function printArea() that takes a pointer to the base class Shape as an argument 
and calls a method area() that should be defined in both derived classes Circle and Rectangle. 
The area() method should return the area of the shape, assuming Circle has an attribute radius and Rectangle has width and height.
